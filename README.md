# <Workday-Scheduler>

## Description

This project is a web based daily planner that shows the current day of week, time by hour, and schedule. The schedule can be updated and filled out. It will also color code time slots based on past, present, and future.

## Development
  Coding this project required me to become much mor familiar with jquery. I mostly needed practice with selectors and that is where most of my issues arose. I also added styling to the page to make it more visually appealing. 


## Usage

    A simple daily planner. Click on a time slot to input your activities, the click the save button to record them.
